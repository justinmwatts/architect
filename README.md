###Version

### Documentation

### Gulp

Architect uses Gulp to compile sass/js, watch your sass/js/html for file updates and run the connect webserver.

```sh
$ cd architect/gulp/
$ npm install
$ gulp
```

If you prefer another task runner, no problem. Architect will work with your choosing. Just remove the gulp director in the root.
