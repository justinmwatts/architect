# Architect

Front End Framework - Responsive mobile first CSS framework with global CSS settings, default HTML element styling and an advanced grid system. Follows the ITCSS (Inverted Triangle CSS) philosophy and BEM methodology. Built with SASS.


###Version
1.1.3


### Setup

Architect uses Gulp to compile sass/js, watch your sass/js/html for file updates and run the connect webserver.

```sh
$ cd architect/gulp/
$ npm install
$ gulp
```

If you prefer another task runner, no problem. Architect will work with your choosing. Just remove the gulp director in the root.
